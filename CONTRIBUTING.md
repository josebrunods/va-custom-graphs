# Contribution Guidelines

To contribute to sas-visualanalytics-customgraphs, please follow these guidelines.

Contributions should follow the conventions of the sas-visualanalytics-customgraphs architecture.

All needed supporting content must be included in the custom graph's subdirectory.  This includes, but is not limited to:

1. The custom graph json file
2. The Visual Analytics report's json file
3. Any ETL code needed to create the data that feeds the custom graph
4. Custom Themes used in the report
5. An image of the final custom graph's output as shown in a Visual Analytics Report

Each custom graph subdirectory should be completely independent, meaning the custom graph and report can be imported from the content in the subdirectory.

Feel free to open an issue to discuss any questions you have or ask about ideas for contributions.

If you have an idea but don't want to code it up yourself, feel free to run it by us.  We are always looking for new ideas for SAS Visual Analytics Custom Graphs!  Your idea might become an example in this repository!
