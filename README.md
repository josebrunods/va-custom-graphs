# Visual Analytics Custom Graphs Examples

The SAS Graph Builder enables users to create custom graphs that can be used as a graph object within a SAS Visual Analytics report.   
The content here are examples of custom graphs referenced in SAS Communities articles. 

Descriptions, source code and supporting ETL for each custom graph are located in the "Examples" folder subdirectories. 

Additionally each subdirectory contains a README file which links to a communities.sas.com article which will have step-by-step instructions on creating the custom graph yourself. 

## Getting Started

After you have downloaded a custom graph json file from this repository, you will need to import it into your SAS Visual Analytics environment.  Instructions on how to import it are located [here](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=vaobj&docsetTarget=n1nixuwj79bthfn15ew5dqldpcis.htm&docsetVersion=8.3&locale=en).

With the graph successfully imported, you can [add it to a new or existing SAS Visual Analytics report](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=vaobj&docsetTarget=n1nixuwj79bthfn15ew5dqldpcis.htm&docsetVersion=8.3&locale=en).
